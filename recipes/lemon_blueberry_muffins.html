  <h2>Description</h2>
  <p>If you're looking for a lemon blueberry muffin recipe that is moist and not overly sweet, this is the one for you. I swear by this recipe!</p>
  <h3>Ingredients</h3>
  <ul>
    <li>3.25 cups all-purpose flour</li>
    <li>4 teaspoons baking powder</li>
    <li>1 teaspoon baking soda</li>
    <li>0.5 teaspoon salt</li>
    <li>1.5 cups white sugar</li>
    <li>1.5 cups milk</li>
    <li>1 cup sour cream</li>
    <li>0.5 cup melted butter</li>
    <li>2 large eggs</li>
    <li>1 tablespoon lemon zest</li>
    <li>1.5 cups frozen blueberries</li>
  </ul>

  <h3>Steps</h3>
  <ol>
    <li>
      Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Line 16 muffin cups with paper liners. 
    </li>
    
    <li>
      Sift flour, baking powder, baking soda, and salt together in a bowl.
    </li>
    
    <li>
      Combine sugar, milk, sour cream, butter, eggs, and lemon zest in a large bowl. Beat with an electric mixer on low speed until blended. Fold in the flour mixture until batter is just moistened. Fold in blueberries; avoid over-mixing because batter will turn purple. 
    </li>
    
    <li>
      Fill muffin cups 3/4 full of batter.
    </li>
    
    <li>
      Bake in the preheated oven until golden brown, 30 to 35 minutes. Let cool for 10 minutes.
    </li>
  </ol>
